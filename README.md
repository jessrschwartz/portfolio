# Jessica Schwartz | Web Developer Portfolio

This repository contains my personal web development portfolio, built as part of my coursework at **San Diego Mesa College** and developed as a living project to showcase my skills in **front-end development, accessibility, and user-centered design**.

The site emphasizes clean structure, responsive layouts, and accessibility-first thinking, with WCAG 2 principles integrated throughout the experience.
